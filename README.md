# Show Stock test module

Using Magento 2.3 write one or more modules that will:
For configurable products
- Show the amount of stock for each variant inside the variant dropdown
- Show products that are out of stock but not allow the option to be selected
For simple products
- Show the amount of stock available next to the stock status.

Consideration should be taken to ensure that:
- It works with multi-way configurable
- Work in an extensible fashion
- Works with MSI
